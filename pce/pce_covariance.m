function C=pce_covariance( pcc, pci )
% PCE_COVARIANCE Computes the covariance between variables in a PC
% expansion.
%   C=PCE_COVARIANCE( PCC, PCI ) computes the covariances between each pair
%   of sets of coefficients fiven in PCC (i.e. PCC(:,i)). PCI (optional)
%   contains the multiindices of the multivariate Hermite polynomials.
