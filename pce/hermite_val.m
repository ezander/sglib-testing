function y=hermite_val( pce_coeff, x )
% HERMITE_VAL Evaluate expansion in Hermite polynomials.
%   Y=HERMITE_VAL( PCE_COEFF, X ) evaluates the Hermite polynomial given
%   by the coefficients in PCE_COEFF at the positions given in X.
%
% Example (<a href="matlab:run_example hermite_val">run</a>)
%   pcc=pce_expand_1d( @exp, 4 );
%   x=linspace(0,10);
%   y=hermite_val( pcc, x );
%   plot(x,y);
