function y=gpc_cdf_1d(a_alpha, V_a, x)
% GPC_CDF_1D Comute CDF of univariate GPC.
%   Y=GPC_CDF_1D(A_ALPHA, V_A, X) computes the cumulative distribution
%   function (CDF) of the GPC variable A given by A_ALPHA and V_A at the
%   point in X. This method works only for univariate GPC variable, i.e.
%   GPCs that depend on only a one dimensional germ (see Notes).
%   GPC_CDF_1D Long description of gpc_cdf_1d.
%
% Notes: This algorithm works by solving the polynomial inequality
%   A(XI)<=X associated with F_A(X)=P(A(XI)<=X). This gives intervals
%   XI_I=[A_I, B_I] in which the inequality is fulfilled. Then P(A(XI)<=X)
%   is given by the sum over F_XI(B_I)-F_XI(A_I), where F_XI is the GPC of
%   the germ.
