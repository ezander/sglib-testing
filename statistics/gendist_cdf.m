function y=gendist_cdf(x, dist, varargin)
% GENDIST_CDF Cumulative distribution function of a gendist.
%   Y=GENDIST_CDF( X, DIST) computes the cdf for the for probablity
%   distribution DIST for all values in X, which may be a vector.
%
% Example (<a href="matlab:run_example gendist_cdf">run</a>)
%   % create a lognormal distribution shifted by 2 to the right
%   dist = gendist_create('lognormal', {0, 1}, 'shift', 2);
%   x = linspace(0, 7);
%   plot(x, gendist_cdf(x, dist));
