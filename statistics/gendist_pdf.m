function y=gendist_pdf(x, dist, varargin)
% GENDIST_PDF Probability distribution function for a gendist.
%   Y=GENDIST_PDF(X, DIST) computes the pdf for the probablity distribution
%   DIST for all values in X
%
% Example (<a href="matlab:run_example gendist_pdf">run</a>)
%   dist = gendist_create('normal', {2, 0.3});
%   x = linspace(0, 5);
%   plot(x, gendist_pdf(x, dist));
