function R=kl_to_ctensor( r_i_k, r_k_alpha )
% KL_TO_CTENSOR Pack a KL expansion into tensor product format.
%   R=KL_TO_CTENSOR( R_I_K, R_K_ALPHA ) packs the KL expansion
%   contained in R_I_K and R_K_ALPHA into the tensor product R.
%   R_I_K contains the coefficients of the KL eigenfunctions with respect
%   to the ansatz functions used and R_K_ALPHA contains the PC expansion
%   of the corresponding KL random variable.
