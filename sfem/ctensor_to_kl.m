function [r_i_k, r_k_alpha]=ctensor_to_kl( R, normalize )
% CTENSOR_TO_KL Unpack a KL expansion from a tensor product.
%   [R_I_K, R_K_ALPHA]=CTENSOR_TO_KL( R ) unpacks a KL expansion
%   from the tensor product R into R_I_K and R_K_ALPHA. R_I_K
%   contains the coefficients of the KL eigenfunctions with respect to the
%   ansatz functions used, and R_K_ALPHA contains the PC expansion of the
%   corresponding KL random variable.
%
%   Note: This function does not guarantee orthogonality of eigenfunctions
%   or uncorrelatedness of random variables like the KL. It just unpacks
%   the information contained in R into the format used by the KL. However,
%   if the tensor was truncated in a "KL-compatible" way, the result should
%   be the same.
